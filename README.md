# Front End Nanodegree Resume Project by Robert Le Monds

I ended up taking longer on this project than expected due to my lack of understanding and confusion of the javascript basics course but I managed to trudge through it.

##Changes that were made to the Original Look

1. Text was made universally Helvetica because I prefer that font family
2. CSS was modified with Gradient Background because I enjoy gradients and how fun they are.
3. Additionally I altered the H1 font to have a 3D effect
4. I used HTML, CSS, JS beautify to clean up the formatting as specified on the project.
5. Finally I used the HTML validation and CSS validation to confirm there weren't any errors.
